# Yozu Web

Yozu is an AI Operating System for Enterprise Travel.

This repository currently contains the public 4-page launch MVP for Yozu:

- public landing
- trip intake
- demoable coordination flow
- contact / human follow-up

It does **not** represent a full OTA, merchant-of-record product, open travel operating system, or completed booking/payment platform.

## Current Product Scope

The live MVP is designed to help a traveler move from intent to a decision-ready next step:

`intent -> decision-ready options -> source/disclosure -> approval -> preflight`

Current routes:

- `/` — public landing
- `/intake` — trip intake and request handoff
- `/demo` — demoable coordination flow using mock/sandbox data
- `/contact` — human follow-up path

## Product Boundaries

Yozu follows these current launch boundaries:

- approval-gated coordination only
- source/disclosure shown before next-step coordination
- preflight re-check before checkout coordination
- mock/sandbox demo states for current product flow
- no automatic booking
- no payment capture
- no merchant-of-record claim
- no booked / paid / ticketed completion state on the public site

## Trip Intake

The current intake flow is designed to collect trip intent and route it to a human follow-up path.

Users can submit:

- destination and dates
- budget range
- travelers
- trip stakes and constraints
- contact details for follow-up

Current intake/privacy boundary:

- submitted details are used only to respond to that trip request
- users should not submit passport, payment, or other sensitive identity data

## Repository Purpose

This repository is the public launch surface for the current Yozu MVP.

It is suitable for:

- landing page iteration
- trip intake UX
- demo flow presentation
- submission/demo-day/public MVP deployment

It is **not** yet the repository for:

- supplier integrations
- real booking/payment execution
- SDKs or open infrastructure platform components
- enterprise or hotel production systems

Those future directions should be documented separately until they become part of the actual shipped product.
